# Music-Band
Cover band site template

Working on this project to combine three passions; 
- singing in a cover band
- using logic in code to create things
- Creating a productive platform for both customers and the band.

# This website plans:

Pre-login:
- Contain standard web pages for potential customers. 
  - Demos of the videos in the backgroud - low res to run on low bandwidth.
- Customer playlist builder to submit and book the band.
- Live requests to watch jam sessions. 
- Song writer requests.

Post-login
- Have a shared video/sound call with other musicians to rehearse together.
- Booked customers can watch jam sessions.
- Hear the songs written from customer requests.
